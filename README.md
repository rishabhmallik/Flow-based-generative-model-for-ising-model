# Flow based generative model for 2D ising model with continuous spins
This is a simple implementation of a flow based generative model inspired from https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08176, using the RealNVP (Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving; Dinh et al., 2017) model of normalizing flows, which constructs the flow function by stacking affine coupling layers. This flow based model is used to generate samples of a 2D Ising model with continuous spins (in the range -1 to +1), and then plotting the average magnetization over these samples at different J/(k<sub>B</sub>T) values where J is the coupling strength of adjacent spins, k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the system. The project contains a code jupyter notebook, and some pretrained models in .pt files for different K=J/(k<sub>B</sub>T) values. You can either change the parameters of the system and the model in the code and train the model, or use the saved model parameters from the .pt files which have been obtained with respect to an 8x8 system.
